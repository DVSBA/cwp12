\section{Conclusions}
We analyzed the particle motion in 2D isotropic homogeneous media. Despite the simplicity
of the medium the displacement can be very complex, specially near the source. In the near
field the particles show a highly non-linear behave. In the far field the displacement
is relatively linear, and it is polarized in two very obvious directions: parallel to the 
direction of displacement for the P-wave and perpendicular to the direction of displacement
in the S-wave case.
