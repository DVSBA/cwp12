\section{Introduction}
In this exercise I analyze the Green's function for isotropic homogeneous media. I perform
the analysis based on the exact analytical expression derived in class. To understand the
expression I change the position of the receiver and study the behavior of the recorded displacement wavefield.
Then, I show the hodograms (displacement plots) from which we can study the polarization of the 
S and P wave, and combined modes.
