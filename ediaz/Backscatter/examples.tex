\section{Examples}
In order to analyze the backscattered energy I use a simple two layers model. I study
 two cases: (1)  constant velocity and density contrast and,
  (2) constant density and hight  velocity contrast.  

For the case of the hard interface in the density model I study the contribution of each case of 
equation ~\ref{eq:cases}. For the hard interfere in the velocity model I study the potential
to observe kinematic changes in the backscattered energy.

In order to analyze the contribution of each case of equation ~\ref{eq:cases} I use the following flow:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Propagate source to model $V(\bf{x}), \rho(\bf{x})$ to obtain $\US=\US^b +\US^n$
\item Propagate source to model $V(\bf{x}), \rho_o(\bf{x})$, where
$\rho_o$ is constant, to obtain $\US^n$.
\item Obtain $\US^b= \US -\US^n$.
\end{enumerate}

The same workflow applies to the receiver wavefield. By doing this we have the ability to separate all 
the cross-correlation cases that contributes to an image $R(\bf{x})$.

\subsection{Understanding the backscattered energy.}

In order to get an understanding of the phenomena, I do a very simple 2D example. I consider
a constant velocity medium as shown in figure \rfn{vel05} and, a two layered density model in figure \rfn{den05}. The idea of having the 
hard interface in the density model is that allow us to split in an easy way the cases shown in equation \ref{eq:cases}. 
The experiment is composed by one shot with a receiver array in the complete surface. The conventional image
given by equation ~\ref{eq:IC} is shown in figure ~\rfn{img05_ref}.

and retreived image (c) and time-lag gather (d). The vertical line shows the location of the time lag gather.}

With this model with variable density we can produce al the cases shown in equation ~\ref{eq:cases}.  In figure 3 I show the individual
contributions. We can see in ~\rfn{img05_nb} how the backscattered energy is concentrated toward the source, this happens because
the backscattered receiver field acts as the source wave field. Similar analysis can be applied in figure ~\ref{fig:img05_bn}, where
the source wave field acts as the receiver wave field. One can see that in the all the cases contributes at some degree with the geology.

We can also analyze how does the backscattering images look in the extended image domain. \rFg{cit05_ref} shows a time-lag
gather located at the center of the model (yellow vertical line in figure ~\ref{fig:vel05}). One can see that the backscattered energy 
is concentrated at $\tau=0$, this event correspond to the contribution of $R(\bf{x})^{nb} + R(\bf{x})^{bn}$ as shown in figures ~\ref{fig:cit05_nb}
and \ref{fig:cit05_bn}. We can see that the $R(\bf{x})^{bb}$ does not produces low frequency energy in the image, since it behaves as $R(\bf{x})^{nn}$, but
with opposite slope as shown in figure ~\ref{fig:cit05_bb} .


\subsection{Backscattered energy: does it carry kinematic information?}

To test the sensibility of the backscattered energy to velocity errors I modify the model: now the hard interface is in the velocity model. The idea
behind this is to simulate a salt-sediment interface. I modify the top layer of the model (sediments) in steps of 5\%, I leave the bottom layer constant. The interface
moves accordantly with the image.  One can see in figures ~\rfn{cit01} to ~\rfn{cit09}  how the backscatterted energy is sensible to the velocity information. One other
aspect to analyze is that the backscattered energy is easy to track since has vertical slope. The error picking location could be defined as the intersection between
$R(\bf{x},\tau)^{nn}$ with $R(\bf{x},\tau)^{bn} +R(\bf{x},\tau)^{nb}$.
