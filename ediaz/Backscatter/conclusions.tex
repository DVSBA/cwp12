\section{Conclusions}
I have demonstrated with a very simple model, that the backscattered
energy contributes to the geological picture of the earth. It also carry kinematic
information that could be used for velocity update.  By maximizing the 
backscattered energy in the image we could optimize the velocity model, which is the 
same as moving the energy towards $\tau=0$ in the time-lag gathers.
