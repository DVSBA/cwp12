\section{Theory}

Here I will review the imaging condition, extended imaging condition,
for cig's and cip's. 

Wavefield splitting with hard boundaries. Understanding of extended images
based on the linearity of the imaging condition(s):

\[
R(\bf{x},\lambda,\tau)= R(\bf{x},\lambda,\tau)^{nn} + R(\bf{x},\lambda,\tau)^{nb} +R(\bf{x},\lambda,\tau)^{bn} +R(\bf{x},\lambda,\tau)^{bb}
\]
