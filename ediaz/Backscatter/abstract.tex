Reverse Time Migration is an imaging technique with the ability to produce images without dip limitations. It is specially suited for 
 very complex models.  Areas like Gulf of Mexico includes salt intrusions which introduces
  backscattering energy in the final image which  is often referred as ``RTM imaging artifacts". 
  In this abstract I show that this backscattered energy   contributes to our image and 
  might be used for migration velocity analysis.
