Reverse Time Migration give us the ability to image steep dips in the context of very complex models.
Areas like Gulf of Mexico includes salt intrusions which introduces backscattering energy in the final
image. In this abstract I show that this backscattered energy contributes to our image and might 
be used for migration velcoity analysis.
