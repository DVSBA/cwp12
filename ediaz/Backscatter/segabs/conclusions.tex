\section{Conclusions}

RTM backscattered events map to zero lag in the extended images when the
velocity is correct. This means that the reflected
receiver wavefield travels in perfect synchronization with the source wavefield and
vice versa. We demonstrate that the RTM backscattered energy is sensitive to kinematics errors
in the velocity model. The backscattered energy
 should be maximized in the image in order to ensure an optimum velocity 
model. The analysis of backscattered energy on extended images provides a definite criterion to update 
velocity models with salt interfaces (i.e in the Gulf of Mexico).
 Further tests are needed to develop automated velocity model update based on the maximization of 
the backscattered energy.
