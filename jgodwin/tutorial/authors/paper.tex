\title{Authors}
The Authors tutorials demonstrate how one can create reproducible documents using the Madagascar processing package and \LaTeX together.  Before beginning these tutorials, you should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item write reproducible scripts to process and analyze your data,
    \item and produce reproducible plots for your papers.
\end{itemize}
Both of these tasks were illustrated in the Users tutorials.  If you have not completed them yet, then please do so before starting this tutorial.

By the end of the Authors tutorials, you should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item build an SEG abstract,
    \item build an EAGE abstract,
    \item build a paper for Geophysics,
    \item build a CSM thesis,
    \item build a CWP report,
    \item build handouts and slides,
    \item integrate custom graphics in your documents,
    \item and add/modify Latex class files to add desired functionality.
\end{itemize}
After completing this tutorial series, you will be able to maximize your research productivity using Madagascar.
