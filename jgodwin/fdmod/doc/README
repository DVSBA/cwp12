This folder allows you to build the manual for the 
acoustic and elastic modeling codes.

The awe and ewe folders contain example SConstructs to help you get 
modeling.

For more details on acceptable parameters for modeling see the 
detailed manual available online, or you can build it yourself in this
folder.

To build the documentation, make sure you have installed all of 
the Madagascar Latex modules, and then run:
   
   scons 

in this directory.

To build the examples, go into the directory of choice and run scons.
